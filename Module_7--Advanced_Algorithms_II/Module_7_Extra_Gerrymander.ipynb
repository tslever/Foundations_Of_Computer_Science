        "The purpose of this problem is to study Dynamic Programming by considering a Gerrymandering case study. Gerrymandering is the manipulation of electoral district boundaries to favor one's political party over other political parties. Gerrymandering is redistricting to benefit one or more political parties. A \"Gerrymander\" was depicted in an 1812 political cartoon after Governor Elbridge Gerry signed a bill that redistricted Massachusetts to benefit the Democratic-Republican Party. Virginia's fifth district looks like the original Gerrymander. Gerrymandering in the United States may be unconstitutional. According to [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/03/supreme-court-gerrymandering-wisconsin-arguments-243401), in 2017 Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy believed that extreme partisan Gerrymandering might violate the Constitution. On 09/03/2019, in Common Cause v. Lewis, the Wake County Superior Court ruled that a state legislative map violated the North Carolina Constitution. In hearings after Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections was remanded on 03/01/2017, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia held that redistricting in 2011 involved unconstitutional racial Gerrymandering. On 06/27/2019, in Rucho v. Common Cause, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that federal courts cannot review allegations of partisan Gerrymandering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gerrymandering works by political parties maximizing the number of districts in a state with a majority of voters favoring that party. We consider only parties D and R. Districts in a state have roughly the same number of voters. States and districts are composed of precincts. All precincts have the same number of voters. Each precinct belongs to exactly one district. Precincts cannot be divided. We don't consider geographic or legal constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can conduct Gerrymandering as follows. Consider a set of precincts $P = \\{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\\}$ representing all voters in a state. Let a precinct $p$ contain $m$ voters. The state has $s = mn$ voters. Define a district $D$ as a proper subset of $P$. Determine $d$ districts $D_1, D_2, ..., D_d$ that represent all voters in a state and meet the following criteria. For our exploration, $d = 2$. The number of precincts in $D_1$ is equal to the number of precincts in $D_2$. By extension, the number of voters in $D_1$ is equal to the number of voters in $D_2$. The sum of the numbers of voters $R(D_1)$ and $R(D_2)$ in $D_1$ and $D_2$ who favor party $R$ is greater than $\\frac{s}{2}$. By extension, the number of voters $R(D_1)$ or $R(D_2)$ in $D_1$ or $D_2$ who favor party $R$ is greater than $\\frac{s}{2d} = \\frac{s}{4}$. We note if such districts can or cannot be determined."

        "To conduct Dynamic Programming, we will identify a recursive structure of our problem. We formally define our Dynamic Programming Solution as follows. Let Boolean $b(j, k, x, y)$ be true if there exists an assignment to districts of the first $j$ precincts in a state such that exactly $k$ precincts are assigned to district $D_1$, $x$ voters in those $k$ precincts in $D_1$ favor party $R$, and exactly $y$ voters in the remaining $j - k$ precincts in district $D_2$ favor party $R$. We define $b(0, 0, 0, 0)$ to be true and $b(0, k, x, y)$ for non-zero $k$, $x$, and/or $y$ to be false. Recall that $n$ is the number of precincts in the state. Gerrymandering is possible if there exists a value $x > \\frac{s}{4}$ and a value $y > \\frac{s}{4}$ such that $b\\left(n, \\frac{n}{2}, x, y\\right)$ is true.\n",

If we can, then we can assign $k$ out of the first $j$ precincts to $D_1$ such that exactly $x$ voters in $D_1$ favor $R$ and exactly $y$ voters in $D_2$ favor $R$.\n",

        "\n",

        "We solve our recurrence \"bottom up\" or iteratively. We maintain a master memo of reachable j-based states associated with the precinct $p_j$ that was just placed in a district. When iterating over precinct $p_j$, we build a new memo based on our master memo. In building our new memo, we consider placing precinct $p_j$ in $D_1$ and placing precinct $p_j$ in $D_2$. If we choose to place precinct $p_j$ in $D_1$, we memoize in our new memo a new j-based state $(k + 1, x + R(p_j))$. If we choose to place precinct $p_j$ in $D_2$, we memoize in our new memo a new j-based state $(k, x)$.

The value of the item might be a tuple of the values of a j-based state and the number of the district in which $p_j$ was placed. The j-based state might be the solution to the subproblem of placing $p_{j-1}$ in either $D_1$ or $D_2$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the bottom-up Dynamic Programming process finishes, we have all the information we need to determine whether Gerrymandering is possible and to reconstruct an assignment of precincts to districts that are Gerrymandered. We have our master memo of reachable j-based states associated with the precinct $p_j$ that was just placed in a district. Since $p_n$ was just placed, our master memo has reachable n-based states associated with the precinct $p_n$. We also have a dictionary from reachable full states (j, k, x) to tuples of values of their parent j-based states and indicators of whether $p_j$ was placed in $D_1$ or $D_2$. We find in our master memo a reachable n-based state (k = n/2, x) where x is greater than s/4 and y = s - x is greater than s/4 and create a reachable full state (n, n/2, x). In other words, we find in our master memo a state where n/2 precincts are in D_1 and n/2 are in D_2 and the majority of voters in each district favor party R. If no such state exists, then we know that Gerrymandering is impossible. If such a state exists, we add the precinct associated with this state to the corresponding district, find the parent state, add the precinct associated with the parent state to its appropriate district, and so on, thus reconstructing an assignment of precincts to districts."
