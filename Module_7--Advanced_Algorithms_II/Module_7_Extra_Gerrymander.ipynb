        "The purpose of this problem is to study Dynamic Programming by considering a Gerrymandering case study. Gerrymandering is the manipulation of electoral district boundaries to favor one's political party over other political parties. Gerrymandering is redistricting to benefit one or more political parties. A \"Gerrymander\" was depicted in an 1812 political cartoon after Governor Elbridge Gerry signed a bill that redistricted Massachusetts to benefit the Democratic-Republican Party. Virginia's fifth district looks like the original Gerrymander. Gerrymandering in the United States may be unconstitutional. According to [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/03/supreme-court-gerrymandering-wisconsin-arguments-243401), in 2017 Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy believed that extreme partisan Gerrymandering might violate the Constitution. On 09/03/2019, in Common Cause v. Lewis, the Wake County Superior Court ruled that a state legislative map violated the North Carolina Constitution. In hearings after Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections was remanded on 03/01/2017, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia held that redistricting in 2011 involved unconstitutional racial Gerrymandering. On 06/27/2019, in Rucho v. Common Cause, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that federal courts cannot review allegations of partisan Gerrymandering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gerrymandering works by political parties maximizing the number of districts in a state with a majority of voters favoring that party.  Districts in a state have roughly the same number of voters. States and districts are composed of precincts. All precincts have the same number of voters.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can conduct Gerrymandering as follows. Consider a set of precincts $P = \\{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\\}$ representing all voters in a state. Let a precinct $p$ contain $m$ voters. The state has $s = mn$ voters. Define a district $D$ as a proper subset of $P$. Determine $d$ districts $D_1, D_2, ..., D_d$ that represent all voters in a state and meet the following criteria. $d = 2$. The number of precincts in $D_1$ is equal to the number of precincts in $D_2$. By extension, the number of voters in $D_1$ is equal to the number of voters in $D_2$. The sum of the number of voters $R(D_1)$ and $R(D_2)$ in $D_1$ and $D_2$ who favor party $R$ is greater than $\\frac{s}{2}$. By extension, the number of voters $R(D_1)$ or $R(D_2)$ in $D_1$ or $D_2$ who favor party $R$ is greater than $\\frac{s}{2d}$. Note if such districts cannot be determined. "
