Binary heap

Is a heap complete?
What is the height of a heap and how is it determined?
What is the index of the root and the bottom layer?

What is best, average, and worst case complexities of a binary tree, Binary Search Tree, and heap?
Worst case time complexity for BST: O(n)
Average case time complexity for BST: O(log(n))
Worst case time complexity for balanced BST: O(log(n))

"Pre-order", "in-order", and "post-order" apply to traversals, not finding an element.
Pre-order traversal is useful for copying. Post-order traversal is useful for deleting.

How does inserting into a heap work?
